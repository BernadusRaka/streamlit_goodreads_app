On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied ‘droid — a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself as “Murderbot.” Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.<b>Artificial Condition</b>: It has a dark past—one in which a number of humans were killed. But it has only vague memories of the massacre that spawned the title “Murderbot”, and it wants to know more. Teaming up with a Research Transport vessel named ART, Murderbot heads to the mining facility where it went rogue. What it discovers will forever change the way it thinks…<b>Rogue Protocol</b>: The case against the too-big-to-fail GrayCris Corporation is floundering, and more importantly, authorities are beginning to ask more questions about where Dr. Mensah's SecUnit is. And Murderbot would rather those questions went away. For good.<b>Exit Strategy</b>: Having traveled the width of the galaxy to unearth details of its own murderous transgressions, as well as those of the GrayCris Corporation, Murderbot is heading home to help submit evidence that could prevent GrayCris from destroying more colonists in its never-ending quest for profit. But who’s going to believe a SecUnit gone rogue? And what will become of it when it’s caught?<b>Network Effect</b>: When Murderbot's human associates (not friends, never friends) are captured and another not-friend from its past requires urgent assistance, Murderbot must choose between inertia and drastic action. Drastic action it is, then.<b>Fugitive Telemetry</b>: When Murderbot discovers a dead body on Preservation Station, it knows it is going to have to assist station security to determine who the body is (was), how they were killed (that should be relatively straightforward, at least), and why (because apparently that matters to a lot of people—who knew?)

Bezos, the richest man on the planet, has built one of the most efficient wealth-creation machines in history with more than 2% of US household income being spent on nearly 500 million products shipped from warehouses in seventeen countries. Amazon’s business model has not only turned the retail industry and cloud computing inside out, but now its tentacles are squeezing media and advertising, and disrupting the state of technology, the economy, job creation, and society at large. Amazon’s impact is so pervasive that business leaders in nearly every sector around the world need to understand how this force of nature operates.Based on unprecedented behind-the-scenes reporting from 150 sources inside and outside of Amazon, Bezonomics unveils the underlying principles Jeff Bezos uses to achieve his dominance—customer obsession, extreme innovation, and long-term management, all supported by artificial intelligence—and shows how these are being borrowed and replicated by companies across the United States, in China, and elsewhere.

But she knew her man: a famously thoughtful and broad-minded player, he was intrigued by her pitch that she wasn't interested in making money so much as learning about life. She had faced a stretch of personal bad luck, and her reflections on the role of chance had led her to a giant of game theory, who pointed her to poker as the ultimate master class in learning to distinguish between what can be controlled and what can't. And she certainly brought something to the table, including a Ph.D. in psychology and an acclaimed and growing body of work on human behavior and how to hack it. So Seidel was in, and soon she was down the rabbit hole with him, into the wild, fiercely competitive, overwhelmingly masculine world of high-stakes Texas Hold'em, their initial end point the following year's World Series of Poker.<br /><br />But then something extraordinary happened. Under Seidel's guidance, Konnikova did have many epiphanies about life that derived from her new pursuit, including how to better read, not just her opponents but far more importantly herself; how to identify what tilted her into an emotional state that got in the way of good decisions; and how to get to a place where she could accept luck for what it was, and what it wasn't. But she also began to win. And win. In a little over a year, she began making earnest money from tournaments, ultimately totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars.  She won a major title, got a sponsor, and got used to being on television, and to headlines like ""How one writer's book deal turned her into a professional poker player."" She even learned to like Las Vegas.<br /><br />But in the end, Maria Konnikova is a writer and student of human behavior, and ultimately the point was to render her incredible journey into a container for its invaluable lessons. The biggest bluff of all, she learned, is that skill is enough. Bad cards will come our way, but keeping our focus on how we play them and not on the outcome will keep us moving through many a dark patch, until the luck once again breaks our way.",6461111,Maria Konnikova,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1588422221p5/6461111.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1588422221p2/6461111.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6461111.Maria_Konnikova,3.84,29380,3238,,74930649,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.xqHORRkqoGgsWTL4,read,true,291413955,,,,,2024

The daughter of Chinese immigrants, Carrie excelled in school, graduated early from MIT, and climbed the corporate ladder, all in pursuit of the American dream. But at twenty-nine, she’s left her analyst job, dropped out of an MBA program, and is trapped in an unhappy engagement. So when she gets the rare opportunity to work at one of the most prestigious hedge funds in the world, she knows she can’t say no. Fourteen interviews later, she’s in.<br /><br />Carrie is the sole assistant to the firm’s billionaire founder. She manages his work life, becoming the right hand to an investor who can move mountains and markets with a single phone call. Eager to impress, she dives headfirst into the firm’s culture, which values return on time above all else. A luxury-laden world opens up for her, and Carrie learns that money can solve nearly everything.<br /><br />Playing the game at the highest levels, amid the ultimate winners in our winner-take-all economy, Carrie soon finds her identity swallowed whole by work. With her physical and mental health deteriorating, she begins to rethink what it actually means to waste one’s life. A searing examination of our relationship to work, Carrie’s story illuminates the struggle for balance in a world of extremes: efficiency and excess, status and aspiration, power and fortune. <i>Private Equity</i> is a universal tale of self-invention from a dazzling new voice, daring to ask what we’re willing to sacrifice to get to the top—and what it might take to break free and leave it all behind.",22119596,Carrie Sun,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22119596.Carrie_Sun,3.61,3128,417,,196842503,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.iDxKXJGcBBSyMlgt,read,true,291413955,,,,,2024

Now, the eagerly anticipated <i>Words of Radiance</i> continues the epic story and answers many of your questions.</b><br /><br />Six years ago, the Assassin in White, a hireling of the inscrutable Parshendi, assassinated the Alethi king on the very night a treaty between men and Parshendi was being celebrated. So began the Vengeance Pact among the highprinces of Alethkar and the War of Reckoning against the Parshendi.<br /><br />Now the Assassin is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives.<br /><br />Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status ""darkeyes."" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.<br /><br />Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.<br /><br />Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.<br /><br />The doors of the Stormlight Archive first opened to us with <i>The Way of Kings</i>.

It's the story of a boy born to a teenaged single mother in a single-wide trailer, with no assets beyond his dead father's good looks and copper-colored hair, a caustic wit, and a fierce talent for survival. In a plot that never pauses for breath, relayed in his own unsparing voice, he braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities.<br /><br />Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wrote <em>David Copperfield </em>from his experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours. Dickens is not a prerequisite for readers of this novel, but he provided its inspiration. In transposing a Victorian epic novel to the contemporary American South, Barbara Kingsolver enlists Dickens' anger and compassion, and above all, his faith in the transformative powers of a good story. <em>Demon Copperhead</em> speaks for a new generation of lost boys, and all those born into beautiful, cursed places they can't imagine leaving behind.",3541,Barbara Kingsolver,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1714173629p5/3541.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1714173629p2/3541.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3541.Barbara_Kingsolver,4.15,2127557,152439,2022,94935539,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.sThP0--GbGewXAfS,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2023

One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist.<br /><br />His father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.<br /><br />At the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,” he said.<br /><br />It was a wistful comment, not a New Year’s resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of Twitter, the world’s ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.<br /><br />For two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him, and spent hours interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers, and adversaries.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<br /><br />It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.<br /><br />One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<br /><br />Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called <i>The Way of Kings</i>. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<br /><br />Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<br /><br />The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings</i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<br /><br />Speak again the ancient oaths:<br /><br /><b>Life before death.</b><br /><b></b><b>Strength before weakness.</b><br /><b></b><b>Journey before Destination.</b><br /><b></b><br /><b></b>and return to men the Shards they once bore.<br /><br />The Knights Radiant must stand again.",38550,Brandon Sanderson,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1721927489p5/38550.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1721927489p2/38550.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson,4.40,7176407,546616,2010,8134945,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.RFggOR2DSfOMBgpwAAwCqQ,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2023

But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution.

He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within.<br /> <br />A lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals.

Yet each of these demigods was once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago, without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.<br /><br />Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping -- based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god. <br /><br />But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city.

  <br />
  <br />
</i>When Samuel Zemurray arrived in America in 1891, he was tall, gangly, and penniless. When he died in the grandest house in New Orleans sixty-nine years later, he was among the richest, most powerful men in the world. In between, he worked as a fruit peddler, a banana hauler, a dockside hustler, and a plantation owner. He battled and conquered the United Fruit Company, becoming a symbol of the best and worst of the United States: proof that America is the land of opportunity, but also a classic example of the corporate pirate who treats foreign nations as the backdrop for his adventures. In Latin America, when people shouted “Yankee, go home!” it was men like Zemurray they had in mind.<br /><br />            Rich Cohen’s brilliant historical profile <i>The Fish That Ate the Whale</i> unveils Zemurray as a hidden kingmaker and capitalist revolutionary, driven by an indomitable will to succeed. Known as El Amigo, the Gringo, or simply Z, the Banana Man lived one of the great untold stories of the last hundred years. Starting with nothing but a cart of freckled bananas, he built a sprawling empire of banana cowboys, mercenary soldiers, Honduran peasants, CIA agents, and American statesmen. From hustling on the docks of New Orleans to overthrowing Central American governments, from feuding with Huey Long to working with the Dulles brothers, Zemurray emerges as an unforgettable figure, connected to the birth of modern American diplomacy, public relations, business, and war—a monumental life that reads like a parable of the American dream.<br /><br /><br /><i></i><br /><br />",16283,Rich Cohen,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316898307p5/16283.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316898307p2/16283.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16283.Rich_Cohen,3.96,25139,2968,,18345809,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.6-RnzSU6QS__Ur-lHWbe1A,read,true,291413955,,,,,2023

J. Fikry</i> two friends--often in love, but never lovers--come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality.</b><br /><br />On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, <i> Ichigo</i>. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.<br /><br />Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's <i>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</i> is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love.

Then, he turned his attention to a new topic: the society around him. Why was everything such a mess? Why was everyone acting like such a baby? When did things get so tribal? Why do humans do this stuff?<br /><br />This massive topic sent Tim tumbling down his deepest rabbit hole yet, through mountains of history, evolutionary psychology, political theory, neuroscience, and modern-day political movements, as he tried to figure out the answer to a simple question: What’s our problem?<br /><br />Six years later, he emerged from the hole holding this book. What’s Our Problem? is a deep and expansive analysis of our modern times, in the classic style of Wait But Why, packed with original concepts, sticky metaphors, and 300 drawings. The book provides an entirely new framework and language for thinking and talking about today’s complex world. Instead of focusing on the usual left-center-right horizontal political axis, which is all about what we think, the book introduces a verticalaxis that explores how we think, as individuals and as groups. Readers will find themselves on a delightful and fascinating journey that will ultimately change the way they see the world around them.<br /><br />Anyway he wanted to say a lot more about all of this but there was a word limit on this book description so just go read the book.",8404041,Tim Urban,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1680405001p5/8404041.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1680405001p2/8404041.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8404041.Tim_Urban,4.43,8606,892,,125571382,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.ck3b3HsDwyk_Vcwk,read,true,291413955,,true,,,2023

With that in mind, Harvard Business School professor Deepak Malhotra offers a radically different answer to this question.</p><p>Malhotra tells an inspiring story about three unique and adventurous mice—Max, Big, and Zed—who refuse to accept their reality as given. As we watch their lives unfold and intersect, we discover that instead of just blindly chasing after the cheese, each of us has the ability to escape the maze or even reconfigure it to our liking.</p><p>In the face of established practices, traditional ideas, scarce resources, and the powerful demands or expectations of others, we often underestimate our ability to control our own destiny and overcome the constraints we face—or think we face. I Moved Your Cheese reminds us that we can create the new circumstances and realities we want, but first we must discard the often deeply ingrained notion that we are nothing more than mice in someone else’s maze. As Zed explains, “You see, Max, the problem is not that the mouse is in the maze, but that the maze is in the mouse.”</p><p>“Every once in a while a book comes along that makes you question the way things are. This is the book. Deepak Malhotra allows you to glimpse a world of your own making without the limits and barriers that others create. An excellent read.”<br /> <b>—Stephen R. Covey, author of <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> and </b><i><b>The Leader in Me</b></i></p><p>“A magnificent story with a powerful message. As someone who has encouraged scores of professionals into breaking through the maze and defining their own pursuits, I find this to be a gem of a book. A must-read.”<br /> <b>—Vinod Khosla, cofounder and former CEO and Chairman, Sun Microsystems, and founder, Khosla Ventures</b></p><p>“Deepak Malhotra tackles our assumptions about business and life with humor, zest, and wisdom in this delightful fable. If you’ve ever rankled at the thought of being just another mouse in the maze, this is the book for you.”<br /> <b>—Daniel H. Pink, author of <i>Drive</i> and </b><i><b>A Whole New Mind</b></i></p><p>“Deepak Malhotra’s lucid fable, I Moved Your Cheese, is a brilliant counterpoint to Spencer Johnson’s earlier work.

And there’s a reason he’s been targeted for this upgrade. A reason that goes back decades to the darkest part of his past, and a horrific family legacy.<br /><br />Worse still, what’s happening to him is just the first step in a much larger plan, one that will inflict the same changes on humanity at large—at a terrifying cost.<br /><br />Because of his new abilities, Logan’s the one person in the world capable of stopping what’s been set in motion.

In a departure from many analytical approaches, Colburn and Aldern shift their focus from the individual experiencing homelessness to the metropolitan area. Using accessible statistical analysis, they test a range of conventional beliefs about what drives the prevalence of homelessness in a given city—including mental illness, drug use, poverty, weather, generosity of public assistance, and low-income mobility—and find that none explain the regional variation observed across the country. Instead, housing market conditions, such as the cost and availability of rental housing, offer a far more convincing account.

It connects 40 diverse Atlanta neighborhoods to city schools, shopping districts, and public parks, and has already seen a huge payoff in real estate development and local business revenue.<br /><br />Similar projects are in the works around the country, from the Los Angeles River Revitalization and the Buffalo Bayou in Houston to the Midtown Greenway in Minneapolis and the Underline in Miami.

As other cities try to solve the riddle of creating vibrant economies, many have looked to Seattle as a model for tech-driven urban renaissance. However, that success comes with skyrocketing housing costs, increasing homelessness, public safety concerns, persistent racial inequality, and a widening gap between the haves and have-nots. Against that backdrop, big tech has become a popular target.Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist who was one of the first investors in Amazon, draws on his experience in Seattle’s tech boom to offer a vision for how cities and businesses can build a brighter future together. He explores ways that cities can soar to prosperity by creating the conditions that encourage innovation. Like flywheels, livable cities generate momentum by drawing creative citizens who launch businesses. Success attracts more talent, energizing local economies and accelerating further innovation. Alberg emphasizes the importance of city governments and tech companies partnering to address civic challenges. He reflects on why the benefits of the tech boom have not been distributed equally and what business and government leaders must do differently to ensure inclusive growth. The book also examines success stories from smaller cities and their lessons for other up-and-coming tech hubs. Demonstrating the need for innovative thinking that encourages livability alongside economic growth, Flywheels is timely reading for everyone from mayors to business leaders to engaged citizens.",21427836,Tom Alberg,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21427836.Tom_Alberg,3.08,13,2,2021,90628654,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.GLkvZ4Q-WFdz7Wyl,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the <i>Toy Story</i> trilogy, <i>Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, </i>and<i> WALL-E, </i>which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really <i>is</i>. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.<br />  <br /> As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, <i>Toy Story</i> was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:<br />  <br /> • Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.<br /> • If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. <br /> • It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them.<br /> • The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them. <br /> • A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.<br /> • Do not assume that general agreement will lead to change—it takes substantial energy to move a group, even when all are on board.",5618463,Ed Catmull,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1404701341p5/5618463.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1404701341p2/5618463.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5618463.Ed_Catmull,4.22,96808,5813,,25384143,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.N9UZ8Q8SBQ5UJqhhREnSRw,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

The London-born genius was the second-most powerful person at Apple and the creative force who most embodies Jobs's spirit, the man who designed the products adopted by hundreds of millions the world over: the iPod, iPad, MacBook Air, the iMac G3, and the iPhone. In the wake of his close collaborator's death, the chief designer wrestled with grief and initially threw himself into his work designing the new Apple headquarters and the Watch before losing his motivation in a company increasingly devoted more to margins than to inspiration.<br /><br />In many ways, Cook was Ive's opposite. The product of a small Alabama town, he had risen through the ranks from the supply side of the company. His gift was not the creation of new products. Instead, he had invented countless ways to maximize a margin, squeezing some suppliers, persuading others to build factories the size of cities to churn out more units. He considered inventory evil. He knew how to make subordinates sweat with withering questions.<br /><br />Jobs selected Cook as his successor, and Cook oversaw a period of tremendous revenue growth that has lifted Apple's valuation to $2 trillion. He built a commanding business in China and rapidly distinguished himself as a master politician who could forge global alliances and send the world's stock market into freefall with a single sentence.<br /><br />Author Tripp Mickle spoke with more than 200 current and former Apple executives, as well as figures key to this period of Apple's history, including Trump administration officials and fashion luminaries such as Anna Wintour while writing <em>After Steve</em>. His research shows the company's success came at a cost. Apple lost its innovative spirit and has not designed a new category of device in years. Ive's departure in 2019 marked a culmination in Apple's shift from a company of innovation to one of operational excellence, and the price is a company that has lost its soul.",20651167,Tripp Mickle,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1650467881p5/20651167.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1650467881p2/20651167.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20651167.Tripp_Mickle,4.10,2761,260,,92439712,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.eeT34qlnRgF9rmbX,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

When a Strategic Inflection Point hits, the ordinary rules of business go out the window. Yet, managed right, a Strategic Inflection Point can be an opportunity to win in the marketplace and emerge stronger than ever.<br /><br />Grove underscores his message by examining his own record of success and failure, including how he navigated the events of the Pentium flaw, which threatened Intel’s reputation in 1994, and how he has dealt with the explosions in growth of the Internet.

If we can understand what makes these gatherings effective and memorable, then we can reframe and redirect them to benefit everyone, host and guest alike. Parker defines a gathering as three or more people who come together for a specific purpose. When we understand why we gather, she says -- to acknowledge, to learn, to challenge, to change -- we learn how to organize gatherings that are relevant and memorable: from an effective business meeting to a thought-provoking conference; from a joyful wedding to a unifying family dinner. Drawing on her experience as a strategic facilitator who's worked with such organizations as the World Economic Forum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the retail company Fresh, Parker explains how ordinary people can create remarkable occasions, large and small. In dozens of fascinating examples, she breaks down the alchemy of these experiences to show what goes into the good ones and demonstrates how we can learn to incorporate those elements into all of our gatherings.

  <b>The revolutionary movement behind the explosive growth of Intel, Google, Amazon and Uber. </b>
  <br />
  <b> With a foreword by Larry Page, and contributions from Bono and Bill Gates.</b>
</p><p> <i>Measure What Matters</i> is about using Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), a revolutionary approach to goal-setting, to make tough choices in business. </p><p> In 1999, legendary venture capitalist John Doerr invested nearly $12 million in a startup that had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. Doerr introduced the founders to OKRs and with them at the foundation of their management, the startup grew from forty employees to more than 70,000 with a market cap exceeding $600 billion. The startup was Google.</p><p> Since then Doerr has introduced OKRs to more than fifty companies, helping tech giants and charities exceed all expectations. In the OKR model objectives define what we seek to achieve and key results are how those top­ priority goals will be attained. OKRs focus effort, foster coordination and enhance workplace satisfaction. They surface an organization's most important work as everyone's goals from entry-level to CEO are transparent to the entire institution. </p><p> In <i>Measure What Matters,</i> Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations. </p><p> This book will show you how to collect timely, relevant data to track progress - to <i>measure what matters</i>. It will help any organization or team aim high, move fast, and excel. </p>",22373767,John Doerr,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22373767.John_Doerr,3.99,36150,2790,,54960827,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.uv_khF51NjlHlh6_Np4D2g,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2022

Realizing early on that he could not compete and win by playing the same game his bigger competitors were playing, he decided to build a store for educated people of somewhat modest means. He brought in unusual products from around the world and promoted them in the <em>Fearless Flyer</em>, providing customers with background on how they were sourced and their nutritional value. He also gave the stores a tiki theme to reinforce the exotic trader ship concept with employees wearing Hawaiian shirts.<br /><br />In this way, Joe laid down a blueprint for other business owners to follow to build their own unique shopping experience that customers love, and a work environment that employees love being a part of.<br /><br />In <em>Becoming Trader Joe</em>, Joe shares the lessons he learned by challenging the status quo and rethinking the way a business operates. He shows readers of all types:<br /><br /><br />How moving from a pure analytical approach to a more creative, problem-solving approach can drive innovation.<br />How finding an affluent niche of passionate customers can be a better strategy than competing on price and volume.<br />How questioning all aspects of the way you do business leads to powerful results.<br />How to build a business around your values and identity.",16792937,Patty Civalleri,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1493763571p5/16792937.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1493763571p2/16792937.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16792937.Patty_Civalleri,3.46,3728,488,,87129918,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.PV_Q2fqc-oTBsV8Z,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

If we think of them, it’s with a mixture of awe and suspicion. Clearly, they possess a kind of genius—the proverbial Midas Touch. But are the skills they possess transferable? And do they have anything to teach us besides making money?<br /><br />In Richer, Wiser, Happier, William Green draws on interviews that he’s conducted over twenty-five years with many of the world’s greatest investors. As he discovered, their talents extend well beyond the financial realm. The most successful investors are mavericks and iconoclasts who question conventional wisdom and profit vastly from their ability to think more rationally, rigorously, and objectively. They are master game players who consciously maximize their odds of long-term success in markets and life, while also minimizing any risk of catastrophe. They draw powerful insights from many different fields, are remarkably intuitive about trends, practice fanatical discipline, and have developed a high tolerance for pain. As Green explains, the best investors can teach us not only how to become rich, but how to improve the way we think, reach decisions, assess risk, avoid costly errors, build resilience, and turn uncertainty to our advantage.<br /><br />Green ushers us into the lives of more than forty super-investors, visiting them in their offices, homes, and even their places of worship—all to share what they have to teach.

So is their reward, which is whispered to be NSA or CIA recruitment, vast wealth, immortality, or perhaps even the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe itself. But the deeper you get, the more deadly the game becomes. Players have died in the past—and the body count is rising. <br /><br />And now the eleventh round is about to begin. Enter K—a Rabbits obsessive who has been trying to find a way into the game for years. That path opens when K is approached by billionaire Alan Scarpio, the alleged winner of the sixth iteration. Scarpio says that something has gone wrong with the game and that K needs to fix it before Eleven starts or the whole world will pay the price. <br /><br />Five days later, Scarpio is declared missing. Two weeks after that, K blows the deadline and Eleven begins. And suddenly, the fate of the entire universe is at stake.",10127642,Terry Miles,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1636594333p5/10127642.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1636594333p2/10127642.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10127642.Terry_Miles,3.68,16271,2725,,86524394,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.Mdn5ppgTkqh1Nuzo,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

  <b>The future isn't about where we will work, but how. For years we have struggled to balance work and life, with most of us feeling overwhelmed and burned out because our relationship to work is broken. This ""isn't just a book about remote work. It's a book that helps us imagine a future where our lives--at the office <i>and</i> home--are happier, more productive, and genuinely meaningful"" (Charles Duhigg, best-selling author of <i>The Power of Habit</i>).</b>
</b><br /><br /><i>Out of Office</i> is a book for every office worker - from employees to managers - currently facing the decision about whether, and how, to return to the office. The past two years have shown us that there may be a new path forward, one that doesn't involve hellish daily commutes and the demands of jam-packed work schedules that no longer make sense. But how can we realize that future in a way that benefits workers and companies alike?<br /><br />Based on groundbreaking reporting and interviews with workers and managers around the world, <i> Out of Office </i>illuminates the key values and questions that should be driving this conversation: trust, fairness, flexibility, inclusive workplaces, equity, and work-life balance. Above all, they argue that companies need to listen to their employees - and that this will promote, rather than impede, productivity and profitability. As a society, we have talked for decades about flexible work arrangements; this book makes clear that we are at an inflection point where this is actually possible for many employees and their companies. <i>Out of Office</i> is about so much more than zoom meetings and hybrid schedules: it aims to reshape our entire relationship to the office.",20951643,Charlie Warzel,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20951643.Charlie_Warzel,3.74,2651,336,,87563549,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.HQFBPvzZYkUReW8F,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

In <i>Empires of Light</i>, historian Jill Jonnes portrays this extraordinary trio and their riveting and ruthless world of cutting-edge science, invention, intrigue, money, death, and hard-eyed Wall Street millionaires. At the heart of the story are Thomas Alva Edison, the nation’s most famous and folksy inventor, creator of the incandescent light bulb and mastermind of the world’s first direct current electrical light networks; the Serbian wizard of invention Nikola Tesla, elegant, highly eccentric, a dreamer who revolutionized the generation and delivery of electricity; and the charismatic George Westinghouse, Pittsburgh inventor and tough corporate entrepreneur, an industrial idealist who in the era of gaslight imagined a world powered by cheap and plentiful electricity and worked heart and soul to create it. <br /><br />Edison struggled to introduce his radical new direct current (DC) technology into the hurly-burly of New York City as Tesla and Westinghouse challenged his dominance with their alternating current (AC), thus setting the stage for one of the eeriest feuds in American corporate history, the War of the Electric Currents. The battlegrounds: Wall Street, the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, Niagara Falls, and, finally, the death chamber - Jonnes takes us on the tense walk down a prison hallway and into the sunlit room where William Kemmler, convicted ax murderer, became the first man to die in the electric chair. <br /><br /><i>Empires of Light</i> is the gripping history of electricity, the “mysterious fluid,” and how the fateful collision of Edison, Tesla, and Westinghouse left the world utterly transformed.",282828,Jill Jonnes,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1448547998p5/282828.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1448547998p2/282828.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/282828.Jill_Jonnes,3.91,7075,856,,495976,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.rlgQlm_WSJO4rxvriuHSnA,read,true,291413955,,,,,2021

A preeminent scholar, writer, and teacher, he has had a profound influence on millions of people--including Star Wars creator George Lucas. To Campbell, mythology was the “song of the universe, the music of the spheres.” With Bill Moyers, one of America’s most prominent journalists, as his thoughtful and engaging interviewer, <i>The Power of Myth</i> touches on subjects from modern marriage to virgin births, from Jesus to John Lennon, offering a brilliant combination of intelligence and wit. <br /><br />This extraordinary book reveals how the themes and symbols of ancient narratives continue to bring meaning to birth, death, love, and war. From stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and Rome to traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, a broad array of themes are considered that together identify the universality of human experience across time and culture. An impeccable match of interviewer and subject, a timeless distillation of Campbell’s work, <i>The Power of Myth</i> continues to exert a profound influence on our culture. <i> </i><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",20105,Joseph Campbell,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1429114498p5/20105.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1429114498p2/20105.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20105.Joseph_Campbell,4.26,279203,9754,2011,971052,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.FvXCc1seTdlvR1LiYkfkWA,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

With thousands of reporters covering events from all corners of the globe, the Times has the power to influence wars, foment revolution, shape economies and change the very nature of our culture. It doesn’t just cover the news: it creates it.<br /><br />But the institution that is the New York Times is showing cracks. No longer the fact-stringing paper of record once known as the Gray Lady, the Times has become a political lightning rod that divides more often than it unites. It is frequently beset by scandal and has even emerged as a symbol of the political, cultural and social ills plaguing our society.<br /><br />The Gray Lady Winked pulls back the curtain on this illustrious institution to reveal a quintessentially human organization where ideology, ego, power and politics compete with the more humble need to present the facts. In its 10 gripping chapters, The Gray Lady Winked offers readers an eye-opening, often shocking, look at the New York Times’s greatest journalistic failures, so devastating they changed the course of history.<br /><br />These are the stories that mattered most, including the Times’s disastrous coverage of the:<br /><br />Second World War – Holocaust – Rise of the Soviet Union – Cuban Revolution – Vietnam War – Second Palestinian Intifada – Atomic Bombing of Japan – Iraq War – Founding of America<br /><br />The result is an essential look at the tangled relationship between media, power and politics in a post-truth world told with novelistic flair to reveal a uniquely powerful institution’s tortured relationship with the truth.<br /><br />Most importantly of all, The Gray Lady Winked presents a cautionary tale that shows what happens when the guardians of the truth abandon that sacred value in favor of self-interest and ideology—and what this means for our future as much as for our past.",4801419,Ashley Rindsberg,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1619344824p5/4801419.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1619344824p2/4801419.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4801419.Ashley_Rindsberg,3.91,646,89,2021,90618105,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.4IIg_VlVwbvDaOoV,read,true,291413955,,,,,2021

Over the past fifty years in America, partisan identities have merged with racial, religious, geographic, ideological, and cultural identities, attaining a weight that is breaking much in politics and tearing at the bonds that hold the country together.

He traces the feedback loops—between polarized political identities and polarized political institutions—driving the system toward crisis.<br /><br /><i>Why We’re Polarized</i> reveals the structural and psychological forces behind America’s descent into division and dysfunction.

In other words, we have what Julia Galef calls a soldier mindset. From tribalism and wishful thinking, to rationalizing in our personal lives and everything in between, we are driven to defend the ideas we most want to believe--and shoot down those we don't. But if we want to get things right more often, argues Galef, we should train ourselves to have a scout mindset. Unlike the soldier, a scout's goal isn't to defend one side over the other. It's to go out, survey the territory, and come back with as accurate a map as possible. Regardless of what they hope to be the case, above all, the scout wants to know what's actually true. In <i>The Scout Mindset</i>, Galef shows that what makes scouts better at getting things right isn't that they're smarter or more knowledgeable than everyone else. It's a handful of emotional skills, habits, and ways of looking at the world--which anyone can learn. With fascinating examples ranging from how to survive being stranded in the middle of the ocean, to how Jeff Bezos avoids overconfidence, to how superforecasters outperform CIA operatives, to Reddit threads and modern partisan politics, Galef explores why our brains deceive us and what we can do to change the way we think.",18465951,Julia Galef,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1636036634p5/18465951.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1636036634p2/18465951.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18465951.Julia_Galef,4.11,6215,694,,65572070,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.5G5vR6Fy2H2a75AColX5-g,read,true,291413955,,,,,2021

In today's New Gilded Age, the world's moneyed classes have taken conspicuous consumption to new extremes. In <i>Very Important People</i>, sociologist, author, and former fashion model Ashley Mears takes readers inside the exclusive global nightclub and party circuit--from New York City and the Hamptons to Miami and Saint-Tropez--to reveal the intricate economy of beauty, status, and money that lies behind these spectacular displays of wealth and leisure.<br /><br />Mears spent eighteen months in this world of models and bottles to write this captivating, sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking narrative. She describes how clubs and restaurants pay promoters to recruit beautiful young women to their venues in order to attract men and get them to spend huge sums in the ritual of bottle service. These girls enhance the status of the men and enrich club owners, exchanging their bodily capital for as little as free drinks and a chance to party with men who are rich or aspire to be. Though they are priceless assets in the party circuit, these women are regarded as worthless as long-term relationship prospects, and their bodies are constantly assessed against men's money.<br /><br />A story of extreme gender inequality in a seductive world, <i>Very Important People</i> unveils troubling realities behind moneyed leisure in an age of record economic disparity.",4941032,Ashley Mears,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4941032.Ashley_Mears,3.73,1485,196,,74065984,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v2.f0a9fcd6-fd2b-42e2-9845-22b99ef80b39,read,true,291413955,,,,,2021

You’ll go behind the scenes at SNL and Weekend Update (where he’s written some of the most memorable sketches and jokes of the past fifteen years). And you’ll experience the life of a touring stand-up comedian—from performing in rural college cafeterias at noon to opening for Dave Chappelle at Radio City Music Hall.<br /><br />For every accomplishment (hosting the Emmys), there is a setback (hosting the Emmys). And for every absurd moment (watching paramedics give CPR to a raccoon), there is an honest, emotional one (recounting his mother’s experience on the scene of the Twin Towers’ collapse on 9/11).

Less than 20 years after its founding, it boasts the largest constellation of commercial satellites in orbit, has pioneered reusable rockets, and in 2020 became the first private company to launch human beings into orbit. Half a century after the space race it is private companies, led by SpaceX, standing alongside NASA pushing forward into the cosmos, and laying the foundation for our exploration of other worlds.<br /><br />But before it became one of the most powerful players in the aerospace industry, SpaceX was a fledgling startup, scrambling to develop a single workable rocket before the money ran dry. The engineering challenge was immense; numerous other private companies had failed similar attempts. And even if SpaceX succeeded, they would then have to compete for government contracts with titans such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who had tens of thousands of employees and tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. SpaceX had fewer than 200 employees and the relative pittance of $100 million in the bank.<br /><br />In <i>Liftoff</i>, Eric Berger, senior space editor at Ars Technica, takes readers inside the wild early days that made SpaceX. Focusing on the company’s first four launches of the Falcon 1 rocket, he charts the bumpy journey from scrappy underdog to aerospace pioneer. We travel from company headquarters in El Segundo, to the isolated Texas ranchland where they performed engine tests, to Kwajalein, the tiny atoll in the Pacific where SpaceX launched the Falcon 1. Berger has reported on SpaceX for more than a decade, enjoying unparalleled journalistic access to the company’s inner workings. Liftoff is the culmination of these efforts, drawing upon exclusive interviews with dozens of former and current engineers, designers, mechanics, and executives, including Elon Musk. The enigmatic Musk, who founded the company with the dream of one day settling Mars, is the fuel that propels the book, with his daring vision for the future of space.<br /><br />Filled with never-before-told stories of SpaceX’s turbulent beginning, <i>Liftoff</i> is a saga of cosmic proportions.",20786282,Eric  Berger,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1602088770p5/20786282.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1602088770p2/20786282.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20786282.Eric_Berger,4.48,5855,573,,75734217,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.tSS9Tl_QtOIWaE9a,read,true,291413955,,,,,2021

He used examples from his own experiences to explain how high achievers can all too often fall into traps that lead to unhappiness.<br /><br />The speech was memorable not only because it was deeply revealing but also because it came at a time of intense personal reflection: Christensen had just overcome the same type of cancer that had taken his father's life. As Christensen struggled with the disease, the question ""How do you measure your life?"" became more urgent and poignant, and he began to share his insights more widely with family, friends, and students.<br /><br />In this groundbreaking book, Christensen puts forth a series of questions: How can I be sure that I'll find satisfaction in my career?

Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.<br /><br />When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town—and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past.

If we can understand what makes these gatherings effective and memorable, then we can reframe and redirect them to benefit everyone, host and guest alike. Parker defines a gathering as three or more people who come together for a specific purpose. When we understand why we gather, she says -- to acknowledge, to learn, to challenge, to change -- we learn how to organize gatherings that are relevant and memorable: from an effective business meeting to a thought-provoking conference; from a joyful wedding to a unifying family dinner. Drawing on her experience as a strategic facilitator who's worked with such organizations as the World Economic Forum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the retail company Fresh, Parker explains how ordinary people can create remarkable occasions, large and small. In dozens of fascinating examples, she breaks down the alchemy of these experiences to show what goes into the good ones and demonstrates how we can learn to incorporate those elements into all of our gatherings. The result is a book that's both journey and guide, full of big ideas with real-world applications that will change the way you look at a business meeting, a parent-teacher conference, and a backyard barbecue.",17404456,Priya Parker,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1555794346p5/17404456.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1555794346p2/17404456.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17404456.Priya_Parker,3.97,23964,3202,,58588048,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.M2Kh7WTgMCV3Tzw9YuIWqQ,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

We wouldn’t have unraveled DNA or discovered Neptune or figured out how to put 5,000 songs in your pocket. <br /> <br />Though many of us were scared away from this essential, engrossing subject in high school and college, Steven Strogatz’s brilliantly creative, down‑to‑earth history shows that calculus is not about complexity; it’s about simplicity. It harnesses an unreal number—infinity—to tackle real‑world problems, breaking them down into easier ones and then reassembling the answers into solutions that feel miraculous. <br /> <br />Infinite Powers recounts how calculus tantalized and thrilled its inventors, starting with its first glimmers in ancient Greec<br />e and bringing us right up to the discovery of gravitational waves (a phenomenon predicted by calculus). Strogatz reveals how this form of math rose to the challenges of each age: how to determine the area of a circle with only sand and a stick; how to explain why Mars goes “backwards” sometimes; how to make electricity with magnets; how to ensure your rocket doesn’t miss the moon; how to turn the tide in the fight against AIDS. <br /> <br />As Strogatz proves, calculus is truly the language of the universe.

This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field?

In reality, the idea was just one of many more and far worse proposals, like personalized baseball bats and a shampoo delivery service, that Marc Randolph would pitch to his business partner, Reed Hastings, on their commute to work each morning. From this ever-shifting pool of potential ventures the pair, with Hastings as the primary investor and Randolph as the CEO, took a risk and founded Netflix. Not until years later, when a billion dollar company emerged out of a business model that - after countless disasters and flirtations with bankruptcy - seemed destined for failure would the risk pay off and become one of the mostly incredible and unlikely success stories of our time.Now with over 125 million subscribers the triumph of Netflix feels inevitable, but at a time when brick and mortar video rental stores were king and DVD technology had yet to take off, its success was far from guaranteed. From having to pitch his own mother on being an early investor, to a motel business conference room that served as a first office, to helping develop Netflix's now-famous company culture, Marc Randolph's improbable journey exemplifies how anyone with grit, gut instincts and determination can transform the world we live in. Telling his story in energetic, compelling prose, Marc chronicles the personal and professional labors that went into the creation of the unicorn company that has disrupted the very foundations of the entertainment industry.<br /><br />From having to pitch his own mother on being an early investor, to a motel business conference room that he decided would be their first office, to helping develop Netflix's now-famous company culture, Marc Randolph's improbable journey exemplifies how anyone with grit, gut instincts and determination can transform the world we live in.",18965880,Marc Randolph,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1557353143p5/18965880.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1557353143p2/18965880.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18965880.Marc_Randolph,4.22,15467,1239,,68990501,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.z1bp7abxilDqBGmBzistxQ,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

He wanted Amazon to become the everything store, offering limitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively low prices. To do so, he developed a corporate culture of relentless ambition and secrecy that's never been cracked. Until now. Brad Stone enjoyed unprecedented access to current and former Amazon employees and Bezos family members, giving readers the first in-depth, fly-on-the-wall account of life at Amazon.

With <i>In Defense of Food</i>, Pollan proposes a new (and very old) answer to the question of what we should eat that comes down to seven simple but liberating words: ""Eat food. Not too much.

Isaacson’s portrait touched millions of readers.<br /><br />At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology.

Our willingness to move, take risks, and adapt to change have produced a dynamic economy and a tradition of innovation from Ben Franklin to Steve Jobs.<br /><br />The problem, according to legendary blogger, economist and best selling author Tyler Cowen, is that Americans today have broken from this tradition—we’re working harder than ever to <i>avoid</i> change. We're moving residences less, marrying people more like ourselves and choosing our music and our mates based on algorithms that wall us off from anything that might be too new or too different. Match.com matches us in love. Spotify and Pandora match us in music. Facebook matches us to just about everything else.<br /><br />Of course, this “matching culture” brings tremendous music we like, partners who make us happy, neighbors who want the same things. We’re more <i>comfortable</i>. But, according to Cowen, there are significant collateral downsides attending this comfort, among them heightened inequality and segregation and decreased incentives to innovate and create.<br /><i></i><br /><i>The Complacent Class</i> argues that this cannot go on forever. We are postponing change, due to our near-sightedness and extreme desire for comfort, but ultimately this will make change, when it comes, harder. The forces unleashed by the Great Stagnation will eventually lead to a major fiscal and budgetary impossibly expensive rentals for our most attractive cities, worsening of residential segregation, and a decline in our work ethic. The only way to avoid this difficult future is for Americans to force themselves out of their comfortable slumber—to embrace their restless tradition again.",54393,Tyler Cowen,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1241994595p5/54393.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1241994595p2/54393.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/54393.Tyler_Cowen,3.60,14409,1760,,50329837,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ZlhWaveHrg8_0xMPGnmfQw,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

Morale had deteriorated, competition was more intense, and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company's history. ""I knew there was nothing to be gained from arguing over the past,"" Iger writes. ""The only thing that mattered was the future, and I believed I had a clear idea of the direction Disney needed to go."" It came down to three clear ideas: 1) Create the highest quality content Disney could produce. 2) Embrace and adopt technology instead of fighting it. And 3) Think bigger--think global--and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets.<br /><br />Twelve years later, Disney is the largest, most respected media company in the world counting Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and Iger is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our time.<br /><br />Now, he's sharing the lessons he's learned while running Disney and leading its 200,000 employees--taking big risks in the face of historic disruption; learning to inspire the people who work for you; leading with fairness and communicating principles clearly. This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as a studio supervisor at ABC. It's also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the evolving <i>Star Wars</i> myth.<br /><br />""Over the past fourteen years, I think I've learned so much about what real leadership is,"" Iger writes. ""But I couldn't have articulated all of this until I lived it. You can't fake it--and that's one of the key lessons in this book.""",18981546,Robert Iger,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1654191045p5/18981546.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1654191045p2/18981546.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18981546.Robert_Iger,4.41,88049,6485,,69102422,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.lNhVhFlvEQw_zRi4AGtXxg,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

The creative and technical logistics that go into building today's hottest games can be more harrowing and complex than the games themselves, often seeming like an endless maze or a bottomless abyss. In <em>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels, </em>Jason Schreier takes readers on a fascinating odyssey behind the scenes of video game development, where the creator may be a team of 600 overworked underdogs or a solitary geek genius.

Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. ""<i>The Right Stuff</i>,"" he explains, ""became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero."" <p> Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with <i>In Cold Blood</i>. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his ""characters"" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.</p><p> Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon). The author also produces an admiring portrait of John Glenn's apple-pie heroism and selfless dedication. By the time Wolfe concludes with a return to Yeager and his late-career exploits, the narrative's epic proportions and literary merits are secure. Certainly <i>The Right Stuff</i> is the best, the funniest, and the most vivid book ever written about America's manned space program. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>",3083854,Tom Wolfe,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1368273666p5/3083854.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1368273666p2/3083854.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3083854.Tom_Wolfe,3.89,298165,15346,,907221,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.PIwVaPervADcjWmdfjTCHw,,,,,,,"[{'@name': 'read', '@exclusive': 'true', '@id': '291413955', '@review_shelf_id': ''}, {'@exclusive': 'false', '@id': '379042679', '@name': 'rejected', '@review_shelf_id': '3032867131', '@sortable': 'false'}]",

  <b>A stunning, deeply reported investigation into the housing crisis </b>
</b><br /><br />Spacious and affordable homes used to be the hallmark of American prosperity. Today, however, punishing rents and the increasingly prohibitive cost of ownership have turned housing into the foremost symbol of inequality and an economy gone wrong. Nowhere is this more visible than in the San Francisco Bay Area, where fleets of private buses ferry software engineers past the tarp-and-plywood shanties where the homeless make their homes. The adage that California is a glimpse of the nation's future has become a cautionary tale.<br /><br />With propulsive storytelling and ground-level reporting, <i>New York Times</i> journalist Conor Dougherty chronicles America's housing crisis from its West Coast epicenter, peeling back the decades of history and economic forces that brought us here and taking readers inside the activist uprisings that have risen in tandem with housing costs. <br /><br />To tell this new story of housing, Dougherty follows a struggling math teacher who builds a political movement dedicated to ending single-family-house neighborhoods. A teenaged girl who leads her apartment complex against their rent-raising landlord. A nun who tries to outmaneuver private equity investors by amassing a multimillion-dollar portfolio of affordable homes. A suburban bureaucrat who roguishly embraces density in response to the threat of climate change. A developer who manufactures homeless housing on an assembly line.<br /><br />Sweeping in scope and intimate in detail, <i>Golden Gates</i> definitively captures a fundamental political realignment in America as it plays out during a moment of rapid technological and social change.",19238250,Conor Dougherty,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19238250.Conor_Dougherty,4.07,2563,352,,71146758,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.DZwzXXG909ifNHucCf3VhA,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

The constant nodding, pretend concentration, useless rhetorical questions? These tricks make them seem like they know what they’re doing when in fact they have no clue. This behavior is so ingrained, so subtle, and so often mistaken for true intelligence that identifying it, calling it out, or compiling it into an exhaustive digest has never been attempted. Until now.<br /><br />Complete with illustrated tips, examples, and scenarios, <i>100 Tricks</i> gives you actionable ways to use words like 'actionable', in order to sound smart. Every type of meeting is covered, from general meetings where you stopped paying attention almost immediately, to one-on-one meetings you zoned out on, to impromptu meetings you were painfully subjected to at the last minute. It’s all here.<br /><br />Open this book to any page and find an easy-to-digest trick with an even easier-to-digest illustration, guiding you on: how to nail the big meeting by pacing and nodding, the most effective ways to listen to your coworkers while still completely ignoring them, and the key to making your presentations 'interactive'.<br /><br />If you hadn’t noticed these behaviors before, you will see them now - from your colleagues, your managers, and soon yourself. Each trick is a mirror to the reality of what happens in meetings, told in the form of hilariously bad advice - advice that you might just want to take. But probably not.

But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.<br /><br />This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more.

    <i>Thinking in Bets</i>
  </b>
  <b> will train you to combat your own biases, address your weaknesses, and help you become a better and more confident decision-maker.</b>
</b><br /><br />What do you do when you're faced with a big decision? If you're like most people, you use a pro and con list, spend a lot of time second guessing or regretting decisions that don't work out, get caught in analysis paralysis, endlessly seeking other people's opinions and trying to find just that little bit more information that might make you sure, or you do the opposite and just go with your gut feeling. But this is exactly the wrong way to go about combating the biases working against you.

And while most of us do everything we can to reduce it, Stanford psychologist and bestselling author Kelly McGonigal, Ph.D., delivers a startling message: <i>Stress isn’t bad.</i> In <i>The Upside of Stress,</i> McGonigal highlights new research indicating that stress can, in fact, make us stronger, smarter, and happier—if we learn how to embrace it.<br /> <br /><i>The Upside of Stress</i> is the first book to bring together cutting-edge discoveries on the correlation between resilience—the human capacity for stress-related growth—and mind-set, the power of beliefs to shape reality. As she did in <i>The Willpower Instinct, </i>McGonigal combines science, stories, and exercises into an engaging and practical book that is both entertaining and life-changing, showing you:<br /><br />how to cultivate a mind-set to embrace stress<br />how stress can provide focus and energy<br />how stress can help people connect and strengthen close relationships<br />why your brain is built to learn from stress, and how to increase its ability to learn from challenging experiences<br /> <br />McGonigal’s TED talk on the subject has already received more than 7 million views. Her message resonates with people who know they can’t eliminate the stress in their lives and want to learn to take advantage of it. <i>The Upside of Stress</i> is not a guide to getting rid of stress, but a guide to getting <i>better</i> at stress, by understanding it, embracing it, and using it.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3251696,Kelly McGonigal,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1427049996p5/3251696.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1427049996p2/3251696.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3251696.Kelly_McGonigal,4.10,43524,3434,,42819637,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.9_iM1PeJSlguANXFMYbS9g,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

Food availability, income, and life span are up; disease, child mortality, and violence are down — all across the globe. Though the world is far from perfect, necessities and luxuries alike are getting cheaper; population growth is slowing; Africa is following Asia out of poverty; the Internet, the mobile phone, and container shipping are enriching people’s lives as never before. The pessimists who dominate public discourse insist that we will soon reach a turning point and things will start to get worse. But they have been saying this for two hundred years.</p><p>Yet Matt Ridley does more than describe how things are getting better. He explains why. Prosperity comes from everybody working for everybody else. The habit of exchange and specialization—which started more than 100,000 years ago—has created a collective brain that sets human living standards on a rising trend. The mutual dependence, trust, and sharing that result are causes for hope, not despair.</p><p>This bold book covers the entire sweep of human history, from the Stone Age to the Internet, from the stagnation of the Ming empire to the invention of the steam engine, from the population explosion to the likely consequences of climate change. It ends with a confident assertion that thanks to the ceaseless capacity of the human race for innovative change, and despite inevitable disasters along the way, the twenty-first century will see both human prosperity and natural biodiversity enhanced. Acute, refreshing, and revelatory, The Rational Optimist will change your way of thinking about the world for the better. </p>",3151,Matt Ridley,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1228985862p5/3151.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1228985862p2/3151.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3151.Matt_Ridley,4.02,75396,4871,2010,10684114,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.jKBTtbJWb2Qi88fTbU30Fg,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

Thiel's sexuality had been known to close friends and family, but he didn't consider himself a public figure, and believed the information was private.<br /><br />This post would be the casus belli for a meticulously plotted conspiracy that would end nearly a decade later with a $140 million dollar judgment against Gawker, its bankruptcy and with Nick Denton, Gawker's CEO and founder, out of a job. Only later would the world learn that Gawker's demise was not incidental--it had been masterminded by Thiel.<br /><br />For years, Thiel had searched endlessly for a solution to what he'd come to call the ""Gawker Problem."" When an unmarked envelope delivered an illegally recorded sex tape of Hogan with his best friend's wife, Gawker had seen the chance for millions of pageviews and to say the things that others were afraid to say. Thiel saw their publication of the tape as the opportunity he was looking for. He would come to pit Hogan against Gawker in a multi-year proxy war through the Florida legal system, while Gawker remained confidently convinced they would prevail as they had over so many other lawsuit--until it was too late.<br /><br />The verdict would stun the world and so would Peter's ultimate unmasking as the man who had set it all in motion. Why had he done this? How had no one discovered it? What would this mean--for the First Amendment? For privacy? For culture?<br /><br />In Holiday's masterful telling of this nearly unbelievable conspiracy, informed by interviews with all the key players, this case transcends the narrative of how one billionaire took down a media empire or the current state of the free press.

It has led nothing short of a revolution in the entertainment industries, generating billions of dollars in annual revenue while capturing the imaginations of hundreds of millions of people in over 190 countries. But to reach these great heights, Netflix, which launched in 1998 as an online DVD rental service, has had to reinvent itself over and over again. This type of unprecedented flexibility would have been impossible without the counterintuitive and radical management principles that cofounder Reed Hastings established from the very beginning. Hastings rejected the conventional wisdom under which other companies operate and defied tradition to instead build a culture focused on freedom and responsibility, one that has allowed Netflix to adapt and innovate as the needs of its members and the world have simultaneously transformed.<br /><br />Hastings set new standards, valuing people over process, emphasizing innovation over efficiency, and giving employees context, not controls. At Netflix, there are no vacation or expense policies. At Netflix, adequate performance gets a generous severance, and hard work is irrel-evant. At Netflix, you don't try to please your boss, you give candid feedback instead. At Netflix, employees don't need approval, and the company pays top of market. When Hastings and his team first devised these unorthodox principles, the implications were unknown and untested. But in just a short period, their methods led to unparalleled speed and boldness, as Netflix quickly became one of the most loved brands in the world.<br /><br />Here for the first time, Hastings and Erin Meyer, bestselling author of <i>The Culture Map </i>and one of the world's most influential business thinkers, dive deep into the controversial ideologies at the heart of the Netflix psyche, which have generated results that are the envy of the business world. Drawing on hundreds of interviews with current and past Netflix employees from around the globe and never-before-told stories of trial and error from Hastings's own career, <i>No Rules Rules </i>is the fascinating and untold account of the philosophy behind one of the world's most innovative, imaginative, and successful companies.",19792006,Reed Hastings,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19792006.Reed_Hastings,4.28,29109,2541,,74541588,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.UQYj_KeYPB5Vlu3p,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

The cofounders started to cultivate a community of photographers and artisans around the app, but it quickly went mainstream. In less than two years, it caught Facebook’s attention: Mark Zuckerberg bought the company for a historic $1 billion when Instagram was just 13 employees.<br /> <br />That might have been the end of a classic success story. But the cofounders stayed on, trying to maintain Instagram’s beauty, brand, and cachet, considering their app a separate company within the social networking giant. They urged their employees to make changes only when necessary, resisting Facebook’s grow-at-all-costs philosophy in favor of a strategy that highlighted creativity and celebrity. Just as Instagram was about to reach 1 billion users, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg—once supportive of the founders’ autonomy—began to feel threatened by Instagram’s success.<br /> <br />At its heart, <i>No Filter</i> is a human story, as Sarah Frier uncovers how the company’s decisions have fundamentally changed how we interact with the world around us. Frier draws on unprecedented exclusive access—from the founders of Instagram, as well as employees, executives, and competitors; Anna Wintour of <i>Vogue</i>; Kris Jenner of the Kardashian-Jenner empire; and a plethora of influencers, from fashionistas with millions of followers to owners of famous dogs worldwide—to show how Instagram has fundamentally changed the way we shop, eat, travel, and communicate, all while fighting to preserve the values which contributed to the company’s success. <i>No Filter</i> examines how Instagram’s dominance acts as lens into our society today, highlighting our fraught relationship with technology, our desire for perfection, and the battle within tech for its most valuable commodity: our attention.",19284946,Sarah Frier,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1566424706p5/19284946.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1566424706p2/19284946.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19284946.Sarah_Frier,4.11,10367,1181,,71431858,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.I41AuOK00b3YkjxQ394oXw,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i> chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. <br /><br />What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. <br /><br />Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"" he wrote. ""Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'"" <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i> is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.",14031444,Paul Kalanithi,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1456068631p5/14031444.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1456068631p2/14031444.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14031444.Paul_Kalanithi,4.40,714237,55080,,45424659,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.oip55amienPK71A-wDcRGg,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

First elected in 2011, Buttigieg left a successful business career to move back to his hometown, previously tagged by Newsweek as a “dying city,” because the industrial Midwest beckoned as a challenge to the McKinsey-trained Harvard graduate. Whether meeting with city residents on middle-school basketball courts, reclaiming abandoned houses, confronting gun violence, or attracting high-tech industry, Buttigieg has transformed South Bend into a shining model of urban reinvention.</p><br /><p>While Washington reels with scandal, <em>Shortest Way Home</em> interweaves two once-unthinkable success stories: that of an Afghanistan veteran who came out and found love and acceptance, all while in office, and that of a Rust Belt city so thoroughly transformed that it shatters the way we view America’s so-called flyover country.</p>",18045362,Pete Buttigieg,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1723577356p5/18045362.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1723577356p2/18045362.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18045362.Pete_Buttigieg,4.19,20810,2755,2019,62339652,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.-naTLPsa6xbKEjDWOIL2hg,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

His record bests those of legendary investors, including Warren Buffett, George Soros and Ray Dalio. Yet Simons and his strategies are shrouded in mystery. The financial industry has long craved a look inside Simons's secretive hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies and veteran <i>Wall Street Journal </i>reporter Gregory Zuckerman delivers the goods.<br /><br />After a legendary career as a mathematician and a stint breaking Soviet codes, Simons set out to conquer financial markets with a radical approach. Simons hired physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists - most of whom knew little about finance - to amass piles of data and build algorithms hunting for the deeply hidden patterns in global markets. Experts scoffed, but Simons and his colleagues became some of the richest in the world, their strategy of creating mathematical models and crunching data embraced by almost every industry. Simons and his team used their wealth to upend the worlds of politics, philanthropy and science. They weren't prepared for the backlash.<br /><br />In this fast-paced narrative, Zuckerman examines how Simons launched a quantitative revolution on Wall Street, and reveals the impact that Simons, the quiet billionaire king of the quants, has had on worlds well beyond finance.",3118998,Gregory Zuckerman,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1633830028p5/3118998.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1633830028p2/3118998.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3118998.Gregory_Zuckerman,4.05,26540,1736,,68288870,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.gvGX-5gcxAAITuHTDDUCTQ,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

One thing, primarily: the collaboration between technology and capitalism. In <i>More From Less</i>, McAfee explains how capitalism’s quest for higher profits is a quest for lower costs; materials and resources are expensive, and technological progress allows companies to use fewer of them even as they grow their markets. Modern smartphones take the place of cameras, GPS units, landline telephones, answering machines, tape recorders, and alarm clocks. Precision agriculture lets farmers harvest larger crops while using less water and fertilizer. Passenger cars get lighter, which makes them cheaper to produce and more fuel efficient. This means that, even though there’ll be more people in the future, and they’ll be wealthier and consume more, they’ll do so while using fewer natural resources.<br /><br /> However, the future is not <i>all </i>bright, cautions McAfee. He warns of issues that haven’t been solved, like overfishing and global warming. But overall, <i>More From Less</i> is a revelatory, paradigm-shifting account of how we’ve stumbled into an unexpected balance with nature, and the possibility that our most abundant centuries are ahead of us.",2865914,Andrew McAfee,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1263814817p5/2865914.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1263814817p2/2865914.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2865914.Andrew_McAfee,3.91,18161,1498,,68194583,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.oL7Y4TW_XuLo5jz818Cj1g,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

Adam Higginbotham has written a harrowing and compelling narrative which brings the 1986 disaster to life through the eyes of the men and women who witnessed it firsthand. Drawing on hundreds of hours of interviews conducted over the course of more than ten years, as well as letters, unpublished memoirs, and documents from recently-declassified archives, this book makes for a masterful non-fiction thriller.<br /><br />Chernobyl has become lodged in the collective nightmares of the world: shorthand for the spectral horrors of radiation poisoning, for a dangerous technology slipping its leash, for ecological fragility, and for what can happen when a dishonest and careless state endangers not only its own citizens, but all of humanity. It is a story that has long remained in dispute, clouded from the beginning in secrecy, propaganda, and misinformation.<br /><br /><i>Midnight In Chernobyl</i> is an indelible portrait of history's worst nuclear disaster, of human resilience and ingenuity and the lessons learned when mankind seeks to bend the natural world to his will - lessons which, in the face of climate change and other threats - remain not just vital but necessary.<br /><br />Now, Higginbotham brings us closer to the truth behind this colossal tragedy.",4627346,Adam Higginbotham,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1540499010p5/4627346.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1540499010p2/4627346.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4627346.Adam_Higginbotham,4.38,61012,6870,,62941305,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.BKnihQqeVQEuiojjqREQZw,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020
